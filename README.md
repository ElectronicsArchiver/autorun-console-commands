# autorun-console-commands

This mod allows you to autorun console commands either by hitting hotkeys, or automatically after events like sitting, getting up, sleeping, dying, etc.
After installing this mod you will have 17 text files. Each file has a comment that tells you when it will be executed.You don't need to delete this comment.
You can execute multiple commands from each text file by writing each one of them in a separated line.
After writing your commands you need to enable the respective option from the mcm menu.
If you install ConsoleUtil, commands would execute silently and won't be interrupted if you hit a keyboard key while they are being executed.
